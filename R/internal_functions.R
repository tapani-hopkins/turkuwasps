#' Plot extended scatterplot

#' * A fitted line showing trends (e.g. decreasing catch the more rain there is).

#'
#' @param x Numeric vector of the x positions of each point. E.g. the amount of rain of each sample.
#' @param y Numeric vector of the y positions of each point. Typically the number of wasps caught in each sample, or the number of wasps caught per day.
#' @param res Resolution of the grid. Default is to split the x and y axes into 15 grid lines, giving 14*14=196 grid cells.
#' @param ... Other arguments passed to [image()], which draws the grid cell colours. Will overwrite any default arguments such as `col`. (Argument `x` cannot be overwritten)
#'
#' @note The number of points in each grid cell is scaled before plotting, so that the colour of each grid cell shows the portion of points (of the column of cells) that are in the cell.

#' Add together all the numbers that belong to the same category

#' Helper function used by [get_weights()]. Used to count the total sampling effort for each forest type, trap or other location. This is basically a wrapper for [aggregate()].

#' @param x Vector of numbers to add together.
#' @param by Vector of same length as `x`, giving the category that each number belongs to
#' @param ... Other arguments passed to [aggregate()], which mostly passes them on to [sum()].
#'
#' @return Vector of the sums for each category. Named vector, categories are used as names.
