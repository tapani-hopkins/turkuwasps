#' Get default colours for taxa

#' Relevel locations to default order
#'

#' Filter samples by collecting event of wasps
#'
#' Helper function used by e.g. [resample()]. Filters samples based on the caught wasps. Only samples from the same collecting event(s) as the wasps are kept.
#'
#' @param x Vector of which sample each wasp came from. Character or factor.
#' @param m Data frame with the Malaise sample data. Must contain columns "name" and "event".

#' Get data for locations
#'
#' Helper function used by e.g. [default_bars()]. Gets the data for forest types, traps or other locations.
#'
#' @param x Name of the location type as string. Currently one of "forest_type", "site", "trap" or "sample".
#'
#' @return Data frame with the data of the location.

#' Find out if locations are forest types, sites or traps
#'
#' Helper function used by e.g. [default_bars()]. Checks what kind of locations a vector contains. Currently recognises forest types, sites and traps. Gives an error if some of the locations were not recognised, or different types of location are mixed.
#'
#' @param x Vector of traps, forest types or other locations. Either as strings or factor.

#' Check if a variable is NA (just a single NA)
#'
#' Helper function. Checks if something is exactly NA. I.e. just a single NA, not e.g. a vector of NAs. Useful e.g. when `Ã¬f(is.na(x))` returns an error because `x` may be a vector.
#'
#' @param x What to check.
#'
#' @return TRUE if `x` is a single NA value, otherwise FALSE.
