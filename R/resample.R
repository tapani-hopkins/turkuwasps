#' Fit glm and analyse it
#'
#' Fit generalised linear models to the wasp catches, and get the p values for whether forest type, rain etc affect the catch of each species. This is basically a wrapper for the package [mvabund], functions [manyglm()], [anova.manyglm()], and [summary.manyglm()]. The analyses take a long time to finish, anything from some minutes (`nBoot=9`) to hours (`nBoot=499`)!
#'
#' @param model Character string giving the model to fit. Generally something like "offset(tdiff_log) + days + rain + forest_type + deadwood". The variables should be found as column names in `m`. Converted to [formula], and will accept e.g. interaction terms in the same format as for formulae.
#' @param x Data frame with the wasp data. Must contain columns "sample" and "taxon". 
#' @param m Data frame with the Malaise sample data. Must contain columns "name" and "event".
#' @param ...  Other parameters passed to [anova.manyglm()], and [summary.manyglm()]. These will override any default parameters. In general, there will be little need to adjust anything except `nBoot` (number of resamples). It is nine by default, to give a quick but approximate result. More accurate results will need e.g. `nBoot=499`, which can take several hours to finish.  
#' 
#' @return List with items:
#' * anova Results of [anova.manyglm()]
#' * fit Fitted values for each sample and taxon.
