# turkuwasps

R package for use at the [Zoological Museum of the University of Turku](https://collections.utu.fi/en/zoological-museum/). For analysing the ecology and taxonomy of the wasps collected by Malaise trapping in [Uganda 2014-2015](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2225643) and [Peru 1998-2011](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3559054).

Takes the data of (typically) one subfamily of wasps, and can then:
- plot when and where in the forest they flew
- analyse how the weather and forest type affected each species' catch
- help visualise which species resemble each other
- create a preliminary identification key
- create preliminary species descriptions
