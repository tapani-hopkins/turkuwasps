## code which was used to add weather data to dataset `malaise_sample`
## can be used to update the data, or add more of it

# get the average daily rain (mm) and max temperature (Â°C) for each sample 
for (i in 1:length(dm)){
	
	# find out how much each weather measurement overlaps in time with the sample
	over = overlap(dw, dm[i])
	
	# if there are no weather measurements for this sample, set rain and temp to NA..
