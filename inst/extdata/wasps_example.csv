Trap site description:
Forest gap caused by several fallen trees. Large trunks and branches lying about everywhere, and young successional trees racing up towards the light. Trap was partly next to, and partly underneath, a large forked tree branch (Parinari excelsa ca 40cm diameter after the fork) suspended off the ground.

Original trap site description (verbatim as written in Uganda 2014): 
Near K31-17 trap site. More or less primary forest with large trees, though there are also areas with mre K15 style open canopy and tall undergrowth nearby. There is a largeish (20 m diameter?) gap caused by at least one tree falling, and a large Parinari has lost one of its three main trunks snapped off and fallen into the gap. Quite a mix of branches, fallen quite solid trunks, Palisota and Afromamum, tall thin trees ompeting for the new space - surprisingly shaded given the size of the gap. The fallen Parinari trunk branches into two forks and the trap is in between these. The end of a large fallen trunk almost enters the trap. K31 slope with red clay underneath, though hard to see due to lots of leaf litter.",,0.544028,30.350252,Wgs84,Gps,1497.122803,,Uganda,Kabarole district,23.04.2015 10:32 - 09.05.2015 10:00,Fort Portal,Kibale National Park,Malaise,"Site K31, Malaise trap K31T1, Kanyawara",Uganda 2014-2015,PreservedSpecimen,Adult,F,,1,,,species,Epirhyssa uelensis,"Benoit, 1951","Hopkins, Tapani",,,,,,,
